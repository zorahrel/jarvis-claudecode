# Jarvis Router — Architecture

## Overview
Multi-channel router connecting Telegram, WhatsApp, and Discord to the Claude Code CLI.
Each channel has routes with per-agent capabilities and scoping.

## Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js + tsx (TypeScript)
- **CLI Backend**: Claude Code CLI (`~/.local/share/claude/versions/<version>`)
- **Process model**: 1 persistent process per session key, serial queue, timeout/fallback
- **Config**: YAML (`config.yaml`)
- **Dashboard**: HTTP :3340, HTTPS :3341 (self-signed)

## Core Services (always present)

| Service | Port | Process | Path |
|---------|------|---------|------|
| Router | 3340/3341 | com.jarvis.router (launchd) | `~/.claude/jarvis/router/` |
| ChromaDB | 3342 | com.jarvis.chroma (launchd) | `scripts/chroma-server.py` |
| OMEGA | 3343 | com.jarvis.omega (launchd) | `scripts/omega-server.py` |
| Tray App | — | JarvisTray | `~/.claude/jarvis/tray-app/` |

Extra services can be added via a `services:` section in `router/config.yaml`
(see `router/config.example.yaml`). They show up in the dashboard and can be
managed by the tray app if they provide a `launchd:` config.

## Routing

Routes are thin matchers that map (channel, from/group/guild) to an agent
defined in `agents/<name>/`. Agent behavior (model, tools, MCP, fullAccess,
effort) lives in `agents/<name>/agent.yaml`, not in `config.yaml`.

Routes are evaluated in order: first match wins. Include a catch-all
`{ channel: "*", action: "ignore" }` to drop unmatched messages.

### Capabilities per route
```
vision, voice, email, calendar, subagents, fileAccess,
webSearch, memory, documents, config, launchAgents, mcp,
discord, discord:write, whatsapp, whatsapp:write,
telegram, telegram:write, channels
```

## Messaging MCPs (in-process)

Each connector also exposes its conversation surface as an MCP server inside
the router process. Tool calls reuse the live `discord.js` / Baileys / `grammy`
handles via `services/connectors.ts` — no extra processes, no extra bot tokens,
no extra ports. See `INTEGRATIONS.md` for the full tool matrix and security
model.

```
askClaude(agent, message, sessionKey)
  → buildSdkOptions({ ..., agent, sessionKey })
    → buildMessagingMcps({ agent, sessionKey })
      → if (agent has 'discord'    tool) createDiscordMcp(...)
      → if (agent has 'whatsapp'   tool) createWhatsappMcp(...)
      → if (agent has 'telegram'   tool) createTelegramMcp(...)
      → if (agent has 'channels'   tool) createChannelsMcp(...)
    → SDK attaches MCPs alongside external (~/.claude.json) MCPs
  → tools close over (agent.scope, sessionKey)
    → at call time read services/session-context.ts for current channel/JID
    → enforce per-route allowedGuilds / allowedJids / denyChannels
    → enforce crossChatWriteAllowed for write tools
    → audit log every call (writes at info, reads at debug)
```

WhatsApp deep-history reads shell out to `wacli` (separate SQLite store).
Telegram reads from `services/message-buffer.ts` (ring buffer persisted to
`state/telegram-buffer.json`, populated by the connector on every received
message during router uptime).

## Media Pipeline
```
Connector receives media
  → download to ~/.claude/jarvis/media/
  → process:
    voice/audio → ffmpeg → whisper-cli (large-v3) → text
    image → base64 → Claude vision (content blocks)
    document → pdftotext / readFile → text
    video → ffmpeg extract audio → whisper → text
  → compose full message with [Voice: ...], [Image: ...], [Quoted: ...]
  → send to Claude persistent process
  → cleanup temp files
```

## Memory System
- **ChromaDB** (localhost:3342): indexes `.md` files scoped by agent, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` ONNX locally
- **OMEGA** (localhost:3343): conversation memory in SQLite + `sqlite-vec` + FTS5 + `bge-small-en-v1.5` ONNX locally
- **Embeddings**: fully on-device, no external API
- **Ingestion**: auto-saved after each reply, scope-tagged by session key

## Process Model
- 1 persistent Claude CLI process per session key
- Serial queue per key (no concurrent messages)
- 5 min message timeout, 15 min inactivity kill, 2h max lifetime
- Model fallback: opus → haiku on rate limit
- Crash recovery: respawn on next message

## LaunchAgents
Core (always present) in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`:
- `com.jarvis.router` — KeepAlive
- `com.jarvis.chroma` — KeepAlive
- `com.jarvis.omega` — KeepAlive
- `com.jarvis.tray` — RunAtLoad

User services from `config.yaml` generate their own `com.<user>.<name>.plist`.

## Key Decisions
- Claude Code CLI as backend (not SDK) — OAuth subscription, no API key needed
- launchd per service management (no pm2, no Docker)
- Spawn discipline (see `services/claude.ts` `buildSpawnArgs()`):
  - `--strict-mcp-config` always so nothing leaks from user scope
  - `--setting-sources user,project,local` to inherit the CLI ecosystem (hooks, commands, agents, skills, plugins)
  - `--mcp-config` inline, filtered per-route tool list, or all shared servers when `fullAccess`
  - `JARVIS_SPAWN=1` env var so user hooks can self-guard
- Identity (two layers only — no extra append):
  - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` → user-global common layer
  - `<workspace>/CLAUDE.md` → agent-specific identity (auto-loaded from cwd)
- MCP servers live in `~/.claude/settings.json` — single source of truth between the interactive CLI and Jarvis
- MCP only on routes that require it (per-route filter via `mcp:<name>` tool entries, or all via `fullAccess: true`)
- No Docker — fully native (SQLite + sqlite-vec, ONNX embeddings)
- No external API keys required; Claude Code CLI uses OAuth subscription
- Vision via Claude content blocks

## Skills loading

Jarvis custom skills live in `~/jarvis/skills-marketplace/`, registered with Claude Code as a local-path plugin marketplace (`claude plugin marketplace add ~/jarvis/skills-marketplace`). This path is deliberately **outside `~/.claude/`** because Claude Code 2.1.x blocks all writes to `~/.claude/**` via a hard-coded `safetyCheck` that no permission flag bypasses (`bypassPermissions`, `dangerously-skip-permissions`, `additional-directories`, `PreToolUse` hooks, `permissionPromptTool` — all ineffective against it).

By moving skills outside the protected zone:

- Jarvis agents running from remote channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord) can `Write` new skills directly — no user approval prompt needed.
- Claude Code still discovers and loads them via its native marketplace mechanism, so the CLI experience is identical to skills living in `~/.claude/skills/`.
- The dashboard Skills tab reads `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json` and scans each local-path marketplace's `installLocation`.

Third-party skills (`agent-reach`, `firecrawl`, etc.) remain as symlinks in `~/.claude/skills/` since their source of truth (`~/.agents/skills/`) is maintained outside of Jarvis.
